# Week 1: Pre-lab software checklist

Rika Anderson,
Carleton College


This bioinformatics class will, obviously, require us to do some hands-on bioinformatics. Most of the software you need is already installed on the remote server (i.e. a giant computer) that we'll learn how to log onto next week. However, you'll also need other software for some analyses. Usually, this software is installed in the Carleton computer labs where we do our in-person labs, but this year is obviously a little different.

**If you are at Carleton,** this software is available on the lab computers in CMC110 and in the Hulings computer lab.
If you don't want to have to worry about software installation on your own computer, I recommend working in one of those two computer labs.

**If you are working from home or working at Carleton with your own laptop,** you will need to install software for this class using one of the two options below. Folks at ITS can help you with this if you run into problems.

**Option 1: REMOTELAB.**
  ITS has built a REMOTELAB environment for accessing lab software from personal computers. [ITS Wiki](https://wiki.carleton.edu/x/YgxPB)   

**Option 2: Installation on your local computer.**
  ITS has pulled together information on what software can be installed on personally owned computers.  [ITS Wiki](https://wiki.carleton.edu/x/twdPB)

*Software that you should have installed on your own computer:*

## Terminal to log on to a remote server
If you have a Mac, you should be all set.

If you have a PC or some other operating system, you should install a [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview) terminal if you can.

If that doesn't work, you can use [PuTTY](https://www.howtogeek.com/311287/how-to-connect-to-an-ssh-server-from-windows-macos-or-linux/).


## Text editor
If you have a Mac, I recommend [BBEdit's free version](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

If you have a PC, Microsoft Notepad works, and it should already be on your computer.

## Seaview: alignment visualization
Available for Mac or PC. [Link here](http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview)

## IGV Viewer: mapping and SNP visualization
Available for Mac or PC. There is also a web version that works similarly and may be fine for our purposes, but I haven't thoroughly tested it. [Link here](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)
